Changing EXE's hash to prevent cheat checkers / anti cheats from hashing the cheat

1. Go to https://hash-file.online/
2. Open the exe
3. Scroll to the bottom of the hex numbers
4. Click the "+"
5. Type ALL zeros, adding anything else could result in the EXE failing to open / operate properly
6. The more lines the better
7. Once done press "save file" and replace the current exe
8. Profit!
